In order to accomplish the goal of today's project first I will add my three folders that contain my html index. JavaScript index and CSS index. In my html index I will add my java script and css script tag. I will then add my code in html. The html code that I enter will then take me to my next step of creating a css grid that will allow me to enter my columns and rows which will hold my content in for my game. I will then add four buttons to the bottom of my table and style them in CSS.
